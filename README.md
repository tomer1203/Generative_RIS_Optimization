# Generative_RIS_Optimization
This is the code for the SPAWC submission of the paper  "AI-Aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics
for Rapid Optimization of Programmable Channels"

The code is organized into several modules:
- `config.py`: This module contains the configuration parameters for the simulation.
- `main.py`: This module contains the main function for the simulation.
- `physfad.py`: This module contains the physical model for the simulation.
- `models.py`: This module contains the machine learning models used in the simulation.
- `dataset.py`: This module contains the dataset used for training the machine learning models.
- `utils.py`: This module contains utility functions for the simulation.
- `plot *.py`: This module contains the plotting functions for the simulation.

to run the code simply run the main.py file
```bash
python main.py
```
choose which way to run the code using the configuration.yaml file
